# Truffle React WebClient

When I discovered that scaffold-eth autogenerates a form for each method of the contract that you have compiled in hardhat, the first thing I thought that it was black magic, so I decided to replicate the same behavior but using Truffle since I am more used to it.

## Usage

https://ismaventuras.github.io/Truffle-React-WebClient/

Upload a json file generated by truffle migrate, click on the desired network (right now it only works to a local ganache node) and then all the contracts methods will be generated as a form. The application is connected to your local ganache node so you dont need metamask to use it

## Future implementations

- Metamask connection to test in non local networks
- UI improvement
- Contract events
